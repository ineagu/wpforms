= Pre-built Form Templates =

Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?

Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it's often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.

Whether you're looking to create a simple contact form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.

WPForms comes with <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed =

WPForms' contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed - Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.

You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.

= All the Fields & Features that You Need to Succeed =

From radio buttons to file uploads to multi-page contact forms, we have all the fields you need.

You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.

The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.

See what one business owner has to say about WPForms' contact form:

>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>
> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend contact forms further. That's why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.
